title: "Consistent Distributed Elixir"
date:   2018-03-24
---

Elixir and Erlang provide powerful mechanisms for building systems that are
always available. But when it comes to building distributed systems that need
consistency erlang leaves many of the implementation details up to the
programmer.

This talks discusses the tradeoffs between these two paradigms. It analyzes the
types of garauntees (or lack thereof) that standard erlang tooling gives us.
We wrap up by discussing the process of building an implementation of the Raft
consensus algorithm in Elixir.
