As developers, types are a part of our lives. Far too often types are seen as annoyances instead of as design tools. This leads many developers to cast aside their types often to their detriment.

In this talk weâ€™ll explore powerful type systems present in other languages like Haskell and discuss novel ways that we can leverage Elixir's type system to produce safer and more correct software.
