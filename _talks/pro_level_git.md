Git has become the de facto standard source control solution for many open source projects and companies. But despite its wide adoption Git is a difficult tool to learn. While the basic operations of staging and committing files seem straightforward they can become challenging when working with many other people or when things start to go wrong.

This talk presents several real world scenarios and then discusses ways to use
Git's unique features to solve each problem. Specifically it discusses techniques
for managing branches, resolving merge conflicts, tracking down bugs, recovering
"lost" commits, re-writing history and several other skills.
