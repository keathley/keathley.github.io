Many people come to the world of test driven development because of the security it provides. However, when done correctly TDD provides loads of other benefits; specifically it can help us design better software.

In this talk we'll discuss tools and techniques to drive better designs with tests. Specifically we'll talk about test isolation with mocks and stubs, test speed, designing apis, and more. Everyone will leave with a better understanding of how to utilize TDD and BDD to create not just safer code, but better code.
