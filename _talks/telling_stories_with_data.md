title: "Telling Stories with Data Visualization"

Data visualization lives in the intersection of art and science.
Designing compelling visuals reveals information about our systems,
and in turn allows us to ask new and more interesting questions.
However knowing how to find the stories in our data is hard and
knowing how to tell those story visually is even harder.

In this talk we'll look at historical data visualization techniques and discuss
how we can apply them with modern tools. We'll also examine several case studies
in order to understand the stories that they tell and the tools their creators
used to tell those stories. Finally we'll discuss the role of bias in data
visualization and look at techniques for creating compelling visualizations
without deceiving our audience.
