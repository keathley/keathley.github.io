In the middle of 2019, I rediscovered RSS. I see you rolling your eyes; how could you possibly forget about RSS? I suppose I'd just gotten lazy. I'd allowed Twitter or some crappy news aggregator to dictate what I was reading. But, considering how I could become a more discerning consumer, it occurred to me that RSS hadn't gone anywhere, and I should start using it again.

I'm aware of the power of nostalgia, and I'm sure it's at play here. But I don't care. I miss the weird internet before Google Reader ruined everything. And, most importantly, reading my favorite blogs makes me happy.
