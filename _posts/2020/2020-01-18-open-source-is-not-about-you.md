Rich Hickey posted [this gist](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
back in 2018 about the entitlement of people who use open-source software. I'm not going to re-iterate his points and instead suggest that you give it a read. But, I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes:

> I encourage everyone gnashing their teeth with negativity at what they
> think they can't do instead pick something positive they can do and do it.
