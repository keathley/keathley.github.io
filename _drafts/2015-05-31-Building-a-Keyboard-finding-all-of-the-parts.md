I've recently decided to


## Case

The case presents an interesting challenge.  If you get a kit then you get one
by default.  However, since I've decided to source everything myself I needed
to find a different solution.  Luckily there was a solution in this geekhack
thread.

You can upload the `ready-for-ponoko.svg` file to ponoko.  It's designed to
work with the 3.2mm 24x12 birch plywood material.  From what I can tell the
birch works really well and is easy to work with.  I liked the look of the
birch but in the end I decided to go with acrylic instead.  It was more inline
with my personal aesthetics.  I chose the clear 3mm 31x15 acrylic sheet.  That
may turn out to be a terrible decision.  YMMV
