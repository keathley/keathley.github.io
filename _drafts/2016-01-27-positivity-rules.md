I was exceptionally hostile to new ideas when I was a young programmer.

About 2 years into my career - already at my 2nd RealJob™️ - I had 2 friends. Both were really interested in functional programming. There was 1 Haskell fan and another who was a diehard clojure-ist. Many of our lunches would be spent discussing the merits of different styles of programming, ideas, stuff they were trying out, etc. For the most part I had no idea what they were talking about. I grew up writing C. Actually I didn't know that there was much more beyond C for a long time. Which probably gives you an indication of how much I knew about the larger programming world. When I started writing code professionally I had heard a few people mention FP in passing. I had heard the term "immutable" thrown around, understood the concept of side effects (but didn't see why it was such a big deal). I was completely out of my depth when it came to these sorts of discussions and my natural reaction was to dismiss all of it. I still regret that decision.

It wasn't until almost 4 years after those discussions that I finally got around to learning Haskell and I can honestly say that its one of the most important things that I've done as a programmer. Had I simply been open to having an honest discussion with someone then I might have been able to have that experience 4 years sooner. Instead I allowed my insecurities about my lack of knowledge to hold me back.

I was afraid to acknowledge that I knew less than everyone else. I'd like to say that this is more impostor syndrome then pride. But thats probably only partly true.

One of the constant struggles of this industry is that there's always something new to learn. This can be overwhelming and dismissal becomes the go-to defense mechanism. However, I wonder how many good ideas or life changing paradigms I've casually dismissed just because they ran counter to my status quo. Even more horrifying, I wonder how many *people* I've dismissed just because their ideas ran counter to my status quo.

## The rules for 2016

I'm determined to correct this. To that end these are some rules that I've established for myself:

### 1) Only make positive comparisons between tools.

ie. "X has this awesome thing that we should add to Y". Above all I want to be positive, explore new ideas, and treat others with respect. Lets remember that theres real people working to make awesome things as well.

### 2) Only critique projects that I'm invested in and excited about.

I don't believe that I have any right to criticize anything that I'm not willing to contribute to. Its simply not my place. I want to put that effort into making the things that I love even more awesome.

### 3) Contribute more.

Open source has empowered my career in more ways then I can count. This is the year that I give back.


I don't believe that these are the rules that everyone needs to live by. They're just the rules that I picked for me. Because they're what I need right now to make myself better and to try to make the world better for others as well.
